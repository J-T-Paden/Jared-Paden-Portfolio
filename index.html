    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="./assets/IMG_1783.png" />
    <p>My name is Jared Paden, and I'm from Utah. I started my working career doing blue collar work, like an electircal apprenticeship for about 1.5 years, then moved to multi-unit maintenance, to warehousing, to woodworking, then manufacturing. I'm now looking to completely switch career industries into technology starting with web development. </p>
    <p>I've spent the first year of my working career learning new tools, different practices, working in different environments, working with clients aswell as how to work with other tradesmen. But I would say most importantly, I've learned how to learn efficiently and in fast-paced and unfamiliar environments of all kinds.</p>
