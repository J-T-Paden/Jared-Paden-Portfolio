    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jared Paden, and I'm from Utah. I started my working career doing blue collar work, like an electircal apprenticeship for about 1.5 years, then moved to multi-unit maintenance, to warehousing, to woodworking, then manufacturing. I'm now looking to completely switch career industries into technology starting with web development. </p>
